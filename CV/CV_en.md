# Summary

Proactive, methodical, enthusiastic, curious and passionate about learning and mastering new technologies. This has led me to evolve towards an extremely versatile professional, I can learn easily and change between different contexts, parallelize projects or manage national and international customers.

My work and my knowledge go from the initial offer, evolution, the kick-off the project, the architecture design, scaffolding, agile methodologies, teamwork, clean code and code style, testing, DevOps and automation of environments, deploy and the delivery of the project.

In addition, I can teach and build teams and guide them across implementing agile methodologies and good practices.
I will give value to the jobs of technical lead, or 100% remote jobs.
